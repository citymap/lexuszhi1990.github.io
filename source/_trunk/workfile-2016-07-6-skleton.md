Object Skeleton Extraction in Natural Images by Fusing Scale-associated Deep Side Outputs
-----


In summary, the core contribution of this paper is the proposal of the scale-associated side output layer, which enables both target learning and fusion in a scale-associated way. Therefore, our holistically-nested network is able to localize skeleton pixels with multiple scales.

Some pioneers try to extract skeletons from the gradient
intensity maps computed on natural images. The gradient
intensity map is generally obtained by applying directional
derivative operators to a gray-scale image smoothed by a
Gaussian kernel.

Our method is inspired by [33], which develops a
holistically-nested network for edge detection (HED).
