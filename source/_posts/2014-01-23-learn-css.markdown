### scss to css

To run Sass from the command line, just use

sass input.scss output.css
You can also tell Sass to watch the file and update the CSS every time the Sass file changes:

sass --watch input.scss:output.css
If you have a directory with many Sass files, you can also tell Sass to watch the entire directory:

sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets

### scss

```
sass-convert -F css -T sass original_file.css converted_file.sass
```
